Default / First Player Input
First Player Added
Player Queue Full, ready to link to visitor 
Next player added links player queue to our second queue column “visitor”
On join queue click, players are dumped into visitor queue and sixth man is added into the waiting queue.
Second team added on Join Queue click. Visitor Team is sent to “Home”
Both queues are loaded. Eleventh player sent to player queue to wait for next game.
Home Wins. Visitor is Dropped from that queue and sent back to player library for permanent IO storage
Visitor Wins. Home is dropped and sent back to Player Library and Visitor is sent to Home.
Next five players are added on sixth man Join Queue click. Since home won they receive a win increment and the loser gets a lose increment. Given that we are adding new players, the home team has more wins so they will have the advantage.
